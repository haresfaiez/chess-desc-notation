# Chess descriptive notation emulator

> Descriptive notation is a notation system for recording chess games which was used in English,
> Spanish and French chess literature until about 1980 (Brace 1977:79â€“80) (Sunnucks 1970:325).

## Test

Use `npm test` to run tests

## Chess notation

### Rank
A row of the chess board. We use numbers from 1 to 8 to denote ranks.

### File
A column of the chess board. We refer to each file using the name of the piece
we put in that column in the initial configuration.

### Pieces
* K : King
* Q : Queen
* Kt: Knight (some notations use `N` here)
* B : Bishop
* R : Rook
* P : Pawn

## Problems with descriptive notation
* `B1` is can be either on the queen side or on the king side. You can specify that as
  `KB1` or `QB1`.

## TCR

### [-]
* Need to commit README updates manually
* Sometimes the test pass because it was badly written, not because it fails (you catch it
in the diff analysis).

### [+]
* Works well with types (those tests won't compile in TDD).
* You get another chance to revert if you leave the git message empty.
* Behavior change and structure changes are separated.
* I used to test my code with a `git diff` before committing, now I use `npm run tcr`.
  The cost of revert is low, I get to see the diff, and what I expect to fail is in the test.
  If the test fails, the code should be modified/rewritten better. If the test succed and I notice
  a defect, we have a clean state for the known next test.
* Baby steps will tiny. You will have to introduce one change at a time.
  If you want to introduce two and forget to finish one, the compiler or the test
  disagrees. Example: add new movement for a new piece -> failure.
  You need to first add the piece, tcr, then add the movement, tcr.

## How to
* Emacs `auto-revert-mode`
* Start with failed cases (the non-happy path), e.g Board.move implementation.
* Baby steps: want a refactoring repeated. Either change the design to make failure of test/revert
  less costly (This means better design, less possible states and less bugs, and continuous iteration)
  or one-two-many (change one and commit, change two with the most gap and commit, change the others).
* More time testing/analyzing the code before commit (feedback to fix glitches early, when have little impact).
